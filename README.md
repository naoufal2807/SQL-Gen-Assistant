# 🚀 SQL-Gen-Assistant

## 📄 Overview
**SQL-Gen-Assistant** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tool that translates natural language queries into SQL commands, executes them on a database, and returns results in human-readable form. Initially developed as a Jupyter Notebook, this project aims to provide intuitive database interactions and is planned for future deployment as a standalone application or API service.

## ✨ Features
- 📝 **Natural Language to SQL Translation**: Converts user queries in natural language to SQL syntax.
- 🗄️ **Database Interaction**: Runs SQL commands on a database dump to retrieve relevant data.
- 💬 **Human-Readable Responses**: Outputs query results in a summarized, natural language format.

## 🧰 Current Setup (Jupyter Notebook)
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/naoufal2807/SQL-Gen-Assistant.git
   cd SQL-Gen-Assistant

## 🛣️ Roadmap for Deployment
Planned enhancements include:

- 🌐 **API Development**: Convert the notebook functionality into a RESTful API, making it accessible over the web.
- 💻 **Web Interface**: Design a user-friendly web interface for inputting queries and viewing results.
- 📡 **Database Integration**: Allow connections to live databases or cloud-hosted databases for dynamic data querying.
- 🐳 **Dockerization**: Package the application into a Docker container for easy deployment and scalability.
